# Security design decisions

- Keep state and replay receipts transactional; reject conflicting command keys.
- Derive tenant and roles exclusively from trusted identities.
- Compare independent reviewers by subject, including when one subject holds multiple roles.
- Preserve missing evidence, stale observations and unknown permissions as distinct outcomes.
- Scope exports and retain provenance instead of asserting external truth from a digest.
- Use private local files and exclusive writes for generated material.
- Keep cloud and third-party writes outside these demos.
- Pin CI actions by commit, limit workflow permissions to contents read and avoid persisted checkout credentials.
- Hash-lock Python dependencies and lock exact Node dependencies.

The principal risk is decision laundering: reusing an old assessment after processing dependencies change or accepting missing safeguards as clean. Bind reviewer decisions to the current version and exact evidence, invalidate on subprocessor changes, expire acceptance and require a distinct assessor and reviewer subject.
